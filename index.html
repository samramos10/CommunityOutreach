  <p class="para2">Hello! If you're reading this, then that means you've taken an interest in helping your community. 
  Sometimes helping alone may be a bit intimidating, but with the proper knowledge to succeed you can help others while 
  building your connections and skills. Helping others can range from behind the scenes work, to public speeches about 
  different types of advocacy. For those who are on the introverted side (like myself) but still want to contribute, 
  there are many activities one can do such as helping at an animal shelter or doing a community clean-up. For those who 
  enjoy being in crowds and thrive off of other people's energy, advocating for a good cause spreads awareness in places 
  such as schools which really makes an impact. In this site, you'll find many <a href="resources.html">resources</a> as well as a <a href="guide.html">guide</a> on 
  how to get involved.</p>
